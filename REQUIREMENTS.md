### Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Fitness Class Booking Application
1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for developing a Java-based application that allows users to choose and book fitness classes. The application caters to user management, class scheduling, booking functionalities, waitlisting, and cancellation features. The system is designed to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, ensuring seamless interactions between users and administrators.

2. Objectives
Enable users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
Allow users to select packages (Platinum, Gold, Silver) that determine their booking limits.
Provide a platform for users to book, waitlist, and cancel fitness classes.
Equip administrators with tools to create, schedule, and cancel classes.
Ensure concurrency management for simultaneous booking attempts.
Restore booking quotas upon user cancellations.
Maintain data security and privacy throughout the application.

3. Functional Requirements

3.1 User Management
Registration and Login

Users can create an account by providing necessary details.
Users can log in using their credentials.
User Tiers and Packages

Users select a package during registration: Platinum (10 bookings), Gold (5 bookings), Silver (3 bookings).
Users can upgrade or downgrade their packages.

3.2 Class Management (Admin)
Create Classes

Admins can create different types of classes (e.g., yoga, gym, dance).
Specify class details: type, capacity, duration, and instructor.

Schedule Classes

Admins can schedule classes at specific times.
Multiple classes can be scheduled in a single day.

Cancel Classes

Admins can cancel scheduled classes.
Notifications are sent to booked users and waitlisted users.

3.3 Booking System (User)
Book a Class

Users can view available classes and book if capacity allows.
Booking limits are enforced based on user tier.
Waitlisting

If a class is full, users can join a waitlist.
When a spot becomes available, the first user on the waitlist is automatically booked.
Cancel a Booking

Users can cancel their booking up to 30 minutes before the class starts.
Upon cancellation, their booking quota is restored.
The next user on the waitlist is allocated the slot.

3.4 Concurrency Management
The system handles multiple users attempting to book the same class simultaneously.
Ensures data integrity and consistent booking counts.


4. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance

The system should handle multiple simultaneous users without significant delays.
Booking transactions should be processed in real-time.
Scalability

Designed to accommodate an increasing number of users and classes.
Modular components allow for easy expansion.
Security

Secure user authentication and authorization.
Protect user data and privacy.
Usability

Intuitive user interface for both users and admins.
Clear notifications and error messages.
Maintainability

Clean code adhering to coding standards.
Well-documented classes and methods.


5. Use Cases

5.1 User Registration
Actor: New User
Description: A new user registers by providing personal details and selecting a package.
Preconditions: None
Postconditions: User account is created and stored in the system.

5.2 User Login
Actor: Registered User
Description: A user logs in using their credentials.
Preconditions: User must be registered.
Postconditions: User gains access to their account and functionalities.

5.3 Book a Class
Actor: Logged-in User
Description: User books a class that has available capacity.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has not reached booking limit.
Postconditions: Class is booked, and booking quota is decremented.

5.4 Join Waitlist
Actor: Logged-in User
Description: User joins the waitlist for a full class.
Preconditions: Class is full; user is logged in.
Postconditions: User is added to the waitlist.

5.5 Cancel a Booking
Actor: Logged-in User
Description: User cancels a booked class more than 30 minutes before it starts.
Preconditions: User has a booked class.
Postconditions: Booking is canceled; booking quota is restored; next waitlisted user is booked.

5.6 Admin Creates a Class
Actor: Admin
Description: Admin creates and schedules a new class.
Preconditions: Admin is logged in.
Postconditions: Class is added to the schedule.

5.7 Admin Cancels a Class
Actor: Admin
Description: Admin cancels a scheduled class.
Preconditions: Class is scheduled.
Postconditions: Class is canceled; notifications sent to users.


6. System Architecture Overview
Presentation Layer

8. Additional Considerations
Concurrency Handling

Use synchronization mechanisms to handle concurrent bookings.
Implement locks or atomic transactions for critical sections.
Package Strategy Handling

Implement a strategy pattern for different package tiers.
Easily extendable for new packages or changes in booking limits.
Cancellation Policies

Automated refunds of booking quotas upon cancellation.
Update waitlists and notify users accordingly.


9. Evaluation Criteria

9.1 Design
Object-Oriented Principles
Utilize classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism effectively.
Data Structures
Choose efficient and scalable data structures for storage.
Modularity
Design the system with modular components for flexibility.
Security
Implement secure authentication and data handling.

9.2 Implementation
Functionality
All features work accurately as per requirements.
Performance
Optimize algorithms for resource efficiency.
Code Quality
Maintain readable and maintainable code with comments.
Error Handling
Implement comprehensive exception handling for robustness.


10. Conclusion
